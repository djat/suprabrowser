/**
 * Package for "refactor" annotations.
 * Refactor annotations is used for search changed code or code that need some action in editor.
 * 
 * Some refactoring stretches for long time. Refactor annotation is a way to 
 * mark/save some significant information about refactoring that will be actual 
 * until the end of refactoring (and may be some time after).
 * 
 * It' more effective than commenting because of IDE support for search.
